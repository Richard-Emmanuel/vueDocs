Vue's rendering mechanism is a core part of its architecture, enabling efficient updates to the DOM. This section provides an overview of how Vue's rendering process works, including the virtual DOM, reactivity system, and the diffing algorithm.
It will also cover how Vue optimizes rendering performance and how developers can leverage these features to build high-performance applications.
